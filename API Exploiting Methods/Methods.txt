Method 1 (DevTools):

So first you will have to think with brain if you see in the code below

---
headers = {'Authorization': token, 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}  
r = requests.get('https://discord.com/api/v8/users/@me', headers=headers)
if r.status_code == 200:
---

so with the "headers" part we are telling python what the headers is gonna be 
In simple words if you know what devtools is this is going to be more self explanatory to you.

for people who doesn't knows if you go to discord.com then login to your account and if you vist devtools by pressing F12 or ctrl + shift + i 
you will see the devtools, now everything in the devtools is not for you. if you ONLY want to specificly make DISCORD TOOLS then

you will have to focus on the network tab => XHR 
only then like if u make a server u will see some thing pop out on your network tab and if u click the thing
and there you will get all the infos for like status code, headers, authorization, user agent, token etc etc
And all this is powered with one simple API Link for example "https://discord.com/api/v8/users/@me"

now that we know what the script does now we will get on requests basically method 2

Method 2 (Requests):
so now we know what the upper script does and other stuff that will be related now how do we do it by python then?
Exactly here is an simple doc which will surely help you
---
import requests

def Post():
	data = {
		"test": "testing123"
	} # This Is Basicly Sending A Post Request To Github Like This, https://github.com/?test=testing123

	headers = {
		"user-agent": "pornhub 2/0"
	} # Sending A Post Request To Github Wit Headers, In This Case Changing User-Agent

	json = {
		"test": "Testing123-Json"
	} # This Will Send Json Data To Github Using Post.

	requests.post("https://github.com/", data=data)

def Get():
	data = {
		"test": "testing123"
	} # This Is Basicly Sending A Get Request To Github Like This, https://github.com/?test=testing123

	headers = {
		"user-agent": "pornhub 2/0"
	} # Sending A Get Request To Github Wit Headers, In This Case Changing User-Agent

	json = {
		"test": "Testing123-Json"
	} # This Will Send Json Data To Github Using Post.
	
	requests.get("https://github.com/", data=data)

def Put():
	data = {
		"test": "testing123"
	} # This Is Basicly Sending A Put Request To Github Like This, https://github.com/?test=testing123

	headers = {
		"user-agent": "pornhub 2/0"
	} # Sending A Put Request To Github Wit Headers, In This Case Changing User-Agent

	json = {
		"test": "Testing123-Json"
	} # This Will Send Json Data To Github Using Post.
	
	requests.put("https://github.com/", data=data)

If you want to know what type of request you wanna send you can see it by 

---
Request Method: TYPE WILL BE HERE
# for example
Request Method: GET
---

one more thing that matters is Status Codes

Method 3 (Status Codes):
so after all this the status code ALSO carrys a big portion of work

Example:
Status Code: 404 

Below will show all the status code meanings
#Note im not good at explaining status codes but still i will try my best

404 = Client Error
200 = Success
204 = No Content success
300 = Redirects

This should give you enough knowledge
